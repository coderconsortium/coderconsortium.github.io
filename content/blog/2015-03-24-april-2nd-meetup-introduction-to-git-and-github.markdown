## An Introduction to Git and Github ##
### Presented by Ed Gibbs, Level 7 Coding Wizard ###

Come one and all for the second in our series of Neophyte discussions.  Ed will be showing techniques for working with git and github.  This will give any Neophyte to these technologies the ability to download (clone) open source code repositories, fork them for yourself, or create your own from scratch.  This is an indespensible tool for any modern software programmer.

As usual there will be free Food provided by Tek Systems, Book and eBook raffles, and even a $200 license to Intellij Idea raffle provided by Jetbrains. Everything a Neophyte needs to get started.

Hope to see you all there!ï»¿
