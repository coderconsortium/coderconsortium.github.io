<p>For this month we have the loquacious Tim Shafer for an exciting and informative neophyte talk that is a fun introduction to programming using the new generation of Rasberry Pi.</p>
<p>Rasbian, a Linux distro for the Pi, includes Scratch, Python, Perl, Ruby, Lua, Java, and of course gcc. Everything a budding programmer needs to get started.
Also included: Mathematica, Sonic Pi, and Minecraft: Pi Edition.</p>
<p>As usual there will be free Food provided by Tek Systems, Book and eBook raffles, and even a $200 license to Intellij Idea raffle provided by Jetbrains. Everything a Neophyte needs to get started.</p>
<p>Hope to see you all there!</p>

We will discuss programming LISP and the book titled "The Little Schemer" by Dan Feidman.  Maybe you heard of LISP and even worked in it some. We will look at two things. One, we will examine using emacs integration with Guile or Dr. Racket using the Geiser plugin for emacs. Two, we will evaluate code from various sections of the book.</p>
<p>The Geiser plugin for Emacs allows a programmer to selectively evaluate blocks of code. Secondly, it allows the programmer to interactively evaluate expressions in a Read Execute Program Loop (REPL). The emacs with Geiser makes a good environment for experimentation and learning.</p>
<p>The book follows a simplistic / repetitive approach to programming and continues with a recursive themed based approach to programming. Scheme makes it easy to represent different data structures and create different constructs without a lot of code. We will take a look at a couple sections and evaluate them in the Emacs, Geiser, Guile (Scheme) environment.<br  /></p>
