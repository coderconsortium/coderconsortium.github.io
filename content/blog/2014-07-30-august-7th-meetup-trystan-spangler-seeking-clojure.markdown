Seeking Clojure

Hey Coders,

Finally your chance to get see what Clojure is all about!  Trystan Spangler will be giving a presentation that will show you:

* How you can integrate Clojure with existing java code.
* How you can use Multi Methods and Macros to be a Clojure Ninja.
* How you can edit running Clojure code.
* How you can model adding, removing and changing over time with immutable data.

Plus you will see how Trystan built an asteroids game in Clojure.

Hope to see you all there!
