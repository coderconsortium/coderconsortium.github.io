### 10 Languages in 10 Minutes ###

Come one and all to the First in the 2015 Neophyte talks. Our Neophyte talks are meant for new Coder Consortium members while still appealing to crusty old-timer professionals like me. 10 languages in 10 minutes (each) will have a panel of Super-Star-Programmer-Ninja-Pirates each giving a talk on a different programming language. Here are the proposed languages:

Python 
Ruby 
JavaScript 
Lisp 
C# 
Java 
Groovy 
Scala 
Kotlin 
Scratch

There will be free Food provided by Tek Systems, Book and eBook raffles, and even a $200 license to Intellij Idea raffle provided by Jetbrains. Everything a Neophyte needs to get started.

Hope to see you all there!ï»¿
