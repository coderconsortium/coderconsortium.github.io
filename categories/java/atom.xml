<p>Come one and all to the First in the 2015 Neophyte talks. Our Neophyte talks are meant for new Coder Consortium members while still appealing to crusty old-timer professionals like me. 10 languages in 10 minutes (each) will have a panel of Super-Star-Programmer-Ninja-Pirates each giving a talk on a different programming language. Here are the proposed languages:</p>
<p>Python
Ruby
JavaScript
Lisp
C#
Java
Groovy
Scala
Kotlin
Scratch</p>
<p>There will be free Food provided by Tek Systems, Book and eBook raffles, and even a $200 license to Intellij Idea raffle provided by Jetbrains. Everything a Neophyte needs to get started.</p>
<p>Hope to see you all there!ï»¿</p>
