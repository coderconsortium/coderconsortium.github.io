## Introduction to Bash for the Neophyte Bash Scripter ##
### Presented by Tom Parker, Level 7 Coding Wizard ###

If you're new to Bash, Bash Scripting, or command line in general then this talk is for you. Bash is an indispensable tool for any programmer. This talk will be an introduction to using bash for the beginner. This is the third of our Neophyte talks targeting new developers or developers who are new to the technology. 

As usual there will be free Food provided by Tek Systems, Book and eBook raffles, and even a $200 license to Intellij Idea raffle provided by Jetbrains. Everything a Neophyte needs to get started.

Hope to see you all there!ï»¿
