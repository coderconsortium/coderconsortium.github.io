<p>Come one and all to the First in the 2015 Neophyte talks. Our Neophyte talks are meant for new Coder Consortium members while still appealing to crusty old-timer professionals like me. 10 languages in 10 minutes (each) will have a panel of Super-Star-Programmer-Ninja-Pirates each giving a talk on a different programming language. Here are the proposed languages:</p>
<p>Python
Ruby
JavaScript
Lisp
C#
Java
Groovy
Scala
Kotlin
Scratch</p>
<p>There will be free Food provided by Tek Systems, Book and eBook raffles, and even a $200 license to Intellij Idea raffle provided by Jetbrains. Everything a Neophyte needs to get started.</p>
<p>Hope to see you all there!ï»¿</p>

<h3>Intro to the Intel Edison module &amp; Intel Galileo board</h3>
<p>The Intel Galileo board is an Arduino-certified development board (and more).  The Intel Edison module is a small general purpose system with many built in features including (WiFi, Bluetooth, and lots of RAM and flash storage).  Both are based on Intel architecture and run a Linux based OS.</p>
<p>We'll discuss and demo:</p>
<pre><code>- what these devices are and what can they do.
- how to get started.
- using the Arduino environment.
- other interesting software tools (Java/Scala, Node.js, ...)
</code></pre>
<p>Sorry about the last mine post.  I suck. - Steve</p>

We will discuss programming LISP and the book titled "The Little Schemer" by Dan Feidman.  Maybe you heard of LISP and even worked in it some. We will look at two things. One, we will examine using emacs integration with Guile or Dr. Racket using the Geiser plugin for emacs. Two, we will evaluate code from various sections of the book.</p>
<p>The Geiser plugin for Emacs allows a programmer to selectively evaluate blocks of code. Secondly, it allows the programmer to interactively evaluate expressions in a Read Execute Program Loop (REPL). The emacs with Geiser makes a good environment for experimentation and learning.</p>
<p>The book follows a simplistic / repetitive approach to programming and continues with a recursive themed based approach to programming. Scheme makes it easy to represent different data structures and create different constructs without a lot of code. We will take a look at a couple sections and evaluate them in the Emacs, Geiser, Guile (Scheme) environment.<br  /></p>

<p>The Great Tom Parker will be giving a talk on exploring concurrency issues and options in java and JVM languages. How STM and actors can ease the pain. Code samples include Java, Clojure, Groovy, Scala, and maybe even jRuby.</p>
<p>Hope to see you all there!</p>

<p>Ed has been cutting his teeth (that expression sounds so painfull) on Clojure web frameworks and will be giving us an overview of his findings.  This is the second talk in our Series on the Clojure alternative JVM programming language.</p>
<p>As usual, we will be meeting at our Sponsors Hacker Lab and Tek Systems will be providing the food.<br  /></p>
<p>Come for the talk, stay for the swag!</p>
<p>Hope to see you all there.</p>

<p>Hey Coders,</p>
<p>Finally your chance to get see what Clojure is all about!  Trystan Spangler will be giving a presentation that will show you:</p>
<ul>
<li>How you can integrate Clojure with existing java code.</li>
<li>How you can use Multi Methods and Macros to be a Clojure Ninja.</li>
<li>How you can edit running Clojure code.</li>
<li>How you can model adding, removing and changing over time with immutable data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus you will see how Trystan built an asteroids game in Clojure.</p>
<p>Hope to see you all there!</p>

<p>Scala provides a library (and DSL) which allows easily adding this recursive descent parsing strategy directly in your application (no separate tools required).  You'll see how parser combinators differ from other parsing methods.  A code demo will show you how to implement a grammar then extend that into 'useful' actions.</p>
