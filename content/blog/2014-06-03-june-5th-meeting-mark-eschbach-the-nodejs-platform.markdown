Join us for a tour of the NodeJS platform given by Mark Eschbach.  Now is your chance to learn all about how to use Node in the real world.  

Food and Drinks will be sponsored by TekSystems.  There will also be raffles for both eBooks and Physical books by O'Reilly, Appress and Manning, as well as a FULL LICENSE to Jetbrains Intellij Idea Ultimate Edition.

As usual we meet at 6:30 at Hacker Lab in Sacramento.  See you there!
