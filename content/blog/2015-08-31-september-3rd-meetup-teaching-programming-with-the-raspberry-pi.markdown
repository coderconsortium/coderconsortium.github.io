Welcome back Consorters!

For this month we have the loquacious Tim Shafer for an exciting and informative neophyte talk that is a fun introduction to programming using the new generation of Rasberry Pi.

Rasbian, a Linux distro for the Pi, includes Scratch, Python, Perl, Ruby, Lua, Java, and of course gcc. Everything a budding programmer needs to get started.
Also included: Mathematica, Sonic Pi, and Minecraft: Pi Edition.

As usual there will be free Food provided by Tek Systems, Book and eBook raffles, and even a $200 license to Intellij Idea raffle provided by Jetbrains. Everything a Neophyte needs to get started.

Hope to see you all there!
