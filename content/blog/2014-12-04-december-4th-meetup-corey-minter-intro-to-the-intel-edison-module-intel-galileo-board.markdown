### Intro to the Intel Edison module & Intel Galileo board ###

The Intel Galileo board is an Arduino-certified development board (and more).  The Intel Edison module is a small general purpose system with many built in features including (WiFi, Bluetooth, and lots of RAM and flash storage).  Both are based on Intel architecture and run a Linux based OS.

We'll discuss and demo:

	- what these devices are and what can they do.
	- how to get started.
	- using the Arduino environment.
	- other interesting software tools (Java/Scala, Node.js, ...)

Sorry about the last mine post.  I suck. - Steve
